Go to the following link:

- Due to the Google APIs involved, users will need to sign in with Google to proceed, just like many other social media login conveniences
- YouTubeApi is utilised to provide a sample data package propping various UI components
- Search bar is fully functional, however, due to the limited information provided within the API response, some details such as the number of views, the length of the videos, among other things, are not displayed in the search result
- Filter options under "upload date" are functional for demonstration purposes
- React context and reducer are used to provide a global state in facilitating interactions between components while keeping them compartmentalized at the same time
- Without a backend, most of the buttons are UI display only
